  why we recommend the 32” M5 FHD Smart Monitor. A 16:9 aspect ratio, HDR 10, FHD resolution, 8(GTG)<br>
  ms response time, and 60Hz refresh rate, isn't the only thing special about this monitor. With sreaming<br>
  capabiilities to watch your favorite streaming services, such as Netflix, YouTube, HBO, and more, this<br>
  monitor will fit in just right with your everyday life.

  Options is what we provide so you don;t have to settle on one pick. Another monitor that you may consider<br>
  is the HP M22f FHD Monitor (2D9J9AS). It has a display size of 21.5", 5(GTG) ms response time,<br>
  FHD (1920 X 1080) native resolution, and a 1000: 1 contrast ratio. Not only that, but it has 300 nits<br>
  of brightness (if you care for that), 178° viewing angles, and 99% sRGB color gamut.
